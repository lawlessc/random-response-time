====================

A simple node server. replies to requests at random times.

The Gatling (http://gatling.io) test scripts are in the user-files sub-directory and should be copied or referenced when running gatling. Use the -sf option http://gatling.io/docs/1.5.6/user_documentation/reference/configuration.html 

NOTE: we have not setup the packages.json so some npm install express and the like are required
